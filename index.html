    <p>Happy Birthday!</p>

    <p>I really wished I could be there to celebrate with you and give you a gift in person. Since that wasn't possible this time, I wanted to do something a little special to convey my thoughts, so I put together this simple space. Consider it a little digital hug and a way for me to formally share my birthday wishes, affection, and how much I appreciate you.</p>

    <p>Thinking back, you really made an impact on how I see things. You've shown me perspectives I used to shy away from, and that has truly been a gift in itself. I consistently find myself learning from you, and that's something I deeply value. I especially admire your composure; you navigate everything with such grace and strength, and it's a quality I find incredibly inspiring.</p>

    <p>On a more personal note, I also wanted to say that my feelings for you haven't changed. I'm still very much into you, Chara. However, more than anything, I value you and your happiness, and I absolutely don't want to force anything.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being you, Chara. I hope this birthday brings you everything you wish for and more. I'm looking forward to when we can connect again soon.</p>

    <p>Wishing you the happiest of birthdays and a wonderful year ahead.</p>

    <p>With much love and appreciation,<br>Rafa</p>
